== Text formatting

=== Bold and italic

_To tame_ the wild wolpertingers we needed to build a *charm*.
But **u**ltimate victory could only be won if we divined the *_true name_* of the __war__lock.


=== Quotation Marks and Apostrophes

"`What kind of charm?`" Lazarus asked. "`An odoriferous one or a mineral one?`" 

Kizmet shrugged. "`The note from Olaf's desk says '`wormwood and licorice,`' but these could be normal groceries for werewolves.`" 

=== Subscript and Superscript

"`Well the H~2~O formula written on their whiteboard could be part of a shopping list, but I don't think the local bodega sells E=mc^2^,`" Lazarus replied.

=== Monospace

"`Wait!`" Indigo plucked a small vial from her desk's top drawer and held it toward us.
The vial's label read: `E=mc^2^`; the `_E_` represents _energy_, but also pure _genius!_

=== Literal Monospace

You can reference the value of a document attribute using the syntax `+{name}+`, where `name` is the attribute name.

`pass:[++]` is the increment operator in C.

=== Marking

Werewolves are #allergic to cinnamon#.
